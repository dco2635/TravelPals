# TravelPals
This website serves as a social media application in which individuals can find travel companions among their group of friends. If one individual wants to travel to Europe the last week of August and has a set budget of $3000, this web application allows this individual to find a travel partner that would have the same budget, destination choice, and timeline. To ensure maximum safety, individuals can only travel with designated friends. The purpose of this application is to provide and plan meaningful experiences with friends and family.
